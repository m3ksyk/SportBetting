# SportBetting
Final Project - Amelco-tailored Coderslab Java course -  betting api  

This application simulates a sport betting site.
It covers the basic functionalities : registering users and user account management, placing bets, 
calculating the rewards, simulating sporting events and odd making.

To run this application, you will need a sql database (named db_bet by default, a db dump is provided in the repository).

Some fixes and tweaks are still in progress.
